# Procedural Rings

### Presented by Khronos, Helmet & Schwartz MFG Limited

Using duct tape, some scrap struts and not-so-top-of-the-line panels, a specialized team of special specialists will build a "HyperRing" sized to your exact needs. This of course happens in an alternate time stream.

## Usage

1. Place a HyperRing Base (they come in 0.625m, 1.25m, and 2.5m sizes)
2. Hover over the base and while pressing the `r` key, move your mouse to adjust the ring radius.
3. Once you have the radius desired you can add a HyperRing strut. The struts come in a few flavors, and can be placed with different symmetry settings and angles for different effects so play around.
4. Once the struts have been placed they will magically lengthened to the radius and a toroid will be created.
5. Once you have a visible toroid you can hover over the toroid and make adjustments to it's size and shape. Use the `r` key to adjust the toroid radius, and `s` to adjust it's shape.

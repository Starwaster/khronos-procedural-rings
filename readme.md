# Procedural "HyperRings"

#### Presented by Khronos, Helmet & Schwartz MFG Limited

Using duct tape, some scrap struts and not-so-top-of-the-line panels, a specialized team of special specialists will build a "HyperRing" sized to your exact needs. This of course happens in an alternate time stream.


## Notes

This project is incomplete, and not useful yet. At this point it only logs the radius / size / shape values.
Use [Alt/Option]+F2 to open the console and use the documented controls to see the values change.. These values will be persisted in your craft file.


## Installation

[Download](https://github.com/jejacks0n/khronos-procedural-rings/archive/master.zip), extract, and place `Assets/Khronos` in `GameData` path.


## Usage

1. Place a HyperRing Base - they come in 0.625m, 1.25m, and 2.5m sizes.
2. Hover over the base and while pressing the `r` key, move your mouse to adjust the ring radius.
3. Once you have the radius desired you can add a HyperRing strut. The struts come in a few flavors, and can be placed with different symmetries and at angles for various effects, so play around.
4. Once the struts have been placed they will be magically lengthened to the specified radius and a toroid will be created connecting them and creating the HyperRing.
5. As a final step you can hover over the toroid or struts and make adjustments to it's size and shape. Use the `t` key to adjust the size, and `s` to adjust shape.
